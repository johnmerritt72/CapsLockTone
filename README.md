# CapsLockTone

This simple app plays a low audio tone continuously while the Caps Lock is turned on. This is helpful for people who like to use Caps Lock frequently, but type without looking at the screen.  Without this app they could easily lose track of whether caps lock is on or off.

The app creates an icon in the system tray. There are settings for the tone frequency and volume, accessible through the app's tray icon.
